            <p>
                In times when misinformation can spread as swiftly as the truth, the need for accurate, respectful, and
                timely communication is more crucial than ever. Defend Armenia leverages the expansive reach of Twitter
                to counteract false narratives and disparaging content about Armenia. By authorizing us to use your
                Twitter account, you become a part of a collective effort to shape a more informed and fair social dialogue.
                Our approach prioritizes facts and respectful engagement, ensuring that the conversation around Armenia is
                rooted in truth and dignity.

            <p>
                Transparency and integrity are the cornerstones of our operations. The bot deployed on your behalf will
                strictly adhere to these principles. It will actively identify and respond to tweets spreading
                misinformation or demeaning content about Armenia, offering factual and respectful counter-narratives.
                The bot will not engage in personal attacks, spread false information, or violate Twitter's guidelines.
                Our goal is not just to defend but to educate and enlighten, fostering a digital space where discourse
                about Armenia is grounded in authenticity and respect.
